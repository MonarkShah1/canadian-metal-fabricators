## Aesthetics & Protection.

A part isn't finished until it's protected. We manage the entire finishing process, ensuring your parts survive the elements (and look good doing it).

### In-House vs. Partner Network
*   **Powder Coating:** We have an automated conveyor line for high-volume runs.
*   **Plating:** We utilize certified local partners for Zinc, Nickel, and Chrome plating to ASTM standards.

### Standards We Meet
*   Salt Spray Testing (ASTM B117)
*   Adhesion Testing
*   Thickness Measurement (Elcometer)

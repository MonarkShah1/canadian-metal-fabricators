## Structural Integrity Meets Aesthetic Finish

Welding is where "metal" becomes "structure." We are fully certified to **CSA W47.1 (Steel)** and **W47.2 (Aluminum)** standards.

### The Hybrid Advantage
*   **Domestic Validation:** All weld procedures (WPS) are developed and tested in our Toronto lab by Canadian CWB engineers.
*   **Global Execution:** Once validated, the WPS is transferred to our global partners where we deploy robotic welding for consistent, low-cost volume.

### Processes
*   **MIG (GMAW):** High-speed production for structural steel frames.
*   **TIG (GTAW):** Precision aesthetic welds for stainless steel enclosures and medical devices.
*   **Spot Welding:** For sheet metal enclosure assembly.

## Welding Services for Construction Projects

Welding transforms individual metal components into functional structures. For Division 5 and Division 10 projects, weld quality directly impacts structural integrity, code compliance, and installation efficiency.

CMF provides welding services for general contractors and fabrication projects across Ontario, handling everything from high-volume production runs to custom structural assemblies.

## Our Welding Capabilities

### MIG Welding (GMAW)
Gas Metal Arc Welding for production-speed fabrication:
- **Applications:** Structural frames, railings, stairs, brackets
- **Materials:** Mild steel, stainless steel
- **Advantages:** High deposition rates, deep penetration, minimal cleanup

MIG welding is our primary process for volume work where speed and consistency matter. Our welders maintain tight control over heat input to minimize distortion on large assemblies.

### TIG Welding (GTAW)
Gas Tungsten Arc Welding for precision and aesthetics:
- **Applications:** Visible architectural elements, thin materials, critical joints
- **Materials:** Stainless steel, aluminum, exotic alloys
- **Advantages:** Superior finish quality, precise heat control, no spatter

When appearance matters—stainless steel handrails, aluminum frames, decorative metalwork—TIG welding delivers the clean, consistent beads that pass architectural inspection.

### Robotic Welding
Automated welding cells for high-volume consistency:
- **Applications:** Repetitive components, long production runs
- **Advantages:** Repeatability ±0.1mm, consistent quality, reduced labor cost

For projects requiring thousands of identical weldments—standard guardrail sections, repetitive brackets, embed plates—robotic welding delivers consistent quality at volume pricing.

### Structural Welding
Heavy fabrication for load-bearing connections:
- **Applications:** Beam connections, column bases, moment frames
- **Materials:** A36, A572, A992 structural steel
- **Requirements:** Full or partial penetration welds per engineer's specification

We work from structural drawings and connection details to fabricate assemblies that meet engineering requirements and fit the field conditions.

## Materials We Weld

### Carbon Steel
The workhorse of construction metal:
- A36 structural shapes and plate
- A500 HSS tubing
- A572 Grade 50 for higher strength applications

### Stainless Steel
For corrosion resistance and aesthetics:
- 304/304L for general corrosion resistance
- 316/316L for marine and chemical environments
- Various finishes: mill, brushed, polished

### Aluminum
Lightweight structural and architectural applications:
- 5052 for general fabrication
- 6061-T6 for structural applications
- 6063 for architectural extrusions

## Our Welding Process

### 1. Drawing Review
We review your fabrication drawings and welding symbols to understand:
- Joint types and weld sizes
- Material specifications
- Inspection and testing requirements
- Sequence considerations

### 2. Procedure Development
Based on material, thickness, and requirements:
- Select appropriate filler metals
- Establish welding parameters
- Determine preheat requirements (if applicable)
- Plan weld sequence to minimize distortion

### 3. Fit-Up & Tacking
Proper preparation ensures quality welds:
- Clean joint surfaces
- Verify gaps and alignment
- Tack weld to maintain position
- Check dimensions before final welding

### 4. Welding & Inspection
Controlled execution and verification:
- Follow established parameters
- Visual inspection of all welds
- Dimensional check of completed assembly
- Documentation as required

## Quality Approach

### Visual Inspection
All welds receive visual examination for:
- Weld profile and size
- Undercut, porosity, cracks
- Spatter and cleanup
- Overall workmanship

### Dimensional Verification
Completed assemblies are checked against drawings:
- Critical dimensions
- Squareness and flatness
- Hole patterns and connection points

### Documentation
We provide documentation as required:
- Material test reports (MTRs)
- Weld maps and inspection records
- Photographs of completed work

## The CMF Advantage for Welding

### Integrated Fabrication
Welding is part of our complete fabrication process:
- Laser cut → Form → Weld → Finish
- Single-source accountability
- Consistent quality throughout

### Capacity for Your Schedule
When timelines compress:
- Multiple welding stations for parallel production
- Overtime capability for urgent work
- Partner capacity for surge requirements

### Construction-Focused
We understand construction project requirements:
- Tolerances that work in the field
- Assemblies that fit together on site
- Staging and sequencing for installation

## Ideal Applications

### Division 5 Miscellaneous Metals
- Stair stringers and platforms
- Guardrails and handrails
- Embed plates and connections
- Equipment supports

### Division 10 Specialties
- Signage structures
- Locker frames
- Partition supports
- Custom brackets

### Structural Connections
- Beam-to-column connections
- Base plates and anchor assemblies
- Bracing connections
- Custom structural details

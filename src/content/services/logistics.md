## We Sell Parts, Not Freight Problems.

International logistics is a headache. We take the pain away by selling everything **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)** to your dock.

### The "Landed Price" Guarantee
The price on your PO is the final price. We absorb the risk of:
*   Fluctuating Container Rates
*   Currency Exchange Swings
*   Customs Delays & Inspection Fees

### Our Network
*   **Ocean:** High-volume FCL/LCL lanes from Nhava Sheva (India) and Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam).
*   **Air:** Emergency air freight accounts for rapid prototype delivery.
*   **Local:** Dedicated trucks for daily milk runs in the GTA.

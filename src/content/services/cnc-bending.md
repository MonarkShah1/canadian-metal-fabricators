## Precision Forming for Complex Geometries

Bending is often the bottleneck in fabrication. At CMF, we use **Amada HG Series** press brakes with active angle measurement to ensure the first part matches the last part, whether it's the 10th or the 10,000th.

### The Hybrid Advantage
*   **Domestic Speed:** Our GTA facility handles prototypes and short runs (under 500 units) with a 3-day turnaround.
*   **Global Scale:** For production runs (5,000+), we utilize robotic bending cells in our India facility to reduce unit costs by up to 40%.

### Capacity Specs
*   **Max Length:** 14ft (Domestic), 20ft (Global)
*   **Max Tonnage:** 250 Tons
*   **Materials:** Steel, Aluminum, Stainless, Copper
*   **Tolerance:** +/- 0.5 degrees

## Better Designs. Lower Costs.

The cheapest part is the one designed correctly from the start. Our engineering team reviews every drawing to identify cost-saving opportunities before metal is cut.

### Our Engineering Value
*   **Material Utilization:** We nest parts to minimize scrap waste.
*   **Feature Simplification:** We suggest design tweaks that reduce bending steps without compromising function.
*   **Tolerancing:** We ensure GD&T callouts are practical for mass production.

### Tools
*   SolidWorks 3D
*   AutoCAD
*   Trumpf TruTops (Nesting)

## Your Warehouse is Our Problem.

Stop tying up capital in inventory. We hold 3-6 months of your stock in our Mississauga facility and release it on your schedule.

### How It Works
1.  **Blanket Order:** You place a 12-month blanket order to lock in global pricing.
2.  **We Stock It:** We produce the batch and store it in our secure warehouse.
3.  **You Pull It:** Release parts weekly or monthly. You are invoiced only when parts ship.

### Benefits
*   **Cash Flow:** Pay only for what you use, when you use it.
*   **Space:** Reclaim your own floor space for assembly, not storage.
*   **Security:** Buffer stock protects you from supply chain shocks.

## Zero Defects. No Exceptions.

We don't rely on "factory self-inspection." Every part we produce—globally or domestically—passes through our Toronto Quality Lab.

### Our Validation Process
1.  **Origin QC:** Our engineers inspect parts at the source factory before shipping.
2.  **Domestic Verification:** Incoming shipments are re-verified in Toronto using our Zeiss CMM.
3.  **Documentation:** You receive full MTRs and dimensional reports with every shipment.

### Equipment
*   **Zeiss Contura CMM**
*   **Virtek LaserQC** for flat pattern verification
*   **Keyence IM Series** Image Dimension Measurement

## High-Precision Laser Cutting for OEMs

At Canadian Metal Fabricators, we bridge the gap between speed and scale. Our **Fiber Laser Cutting** capabilities are designed for supply chain managers who need reliability above all else.

### Why Fiber Laser?
Unlike older CO2 technology, our fiber lasers offer:
1.  **Speed:** up to 3x faster cutting on thin-to-medium gauge metals.
2.  **Accuracy:** Tolerances held to within +/- 0.003".
3.  **Versatility:** Capable of cutting reflective metals like Copper and Brass which traditional lasers cannot touch.

### Capacity & Logistics
We don't just cut parts; we manage flow.
*   **Domestic Speed:** Our GTA facility handles R&D, Rush Orders, and Low-Volume production.
*   **Global Scale:** For high-volume contracts, we utilize our ISO-certified partners in India to lower unit costs while maintaining our local quality guarantee.

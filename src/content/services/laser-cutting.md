## Speed Meets Precision.

Our 10kW fiber lasers cut faster and cleaner than traditional CO2 lasers. With automated loading towers, we run lights-out shifts to keep costs low.

### Capabilities
*   **Mild Steel:** Up to 1.00"
*   **Stainless Steel:** Up to 0.75" (Clean Cut)
*   **Aluminum:** Up to 0.50"
*   **Brass/Copper:** Up to 0.375"

### The Advantage
Fiber technology allows us to cut reflective materials (Copper, Brass, Aluminum) without back-reflection issues, opening up new design possibilities for electrical components.

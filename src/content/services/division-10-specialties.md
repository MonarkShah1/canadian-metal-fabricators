Division 10 Specialties covers the functional and aesthetic metal components that complete a building—signage, lockers, partitions, and protective elements. These items require precision fabrication and often tight timelines as they're installed during the final construction phases.

## Division 10 Challenges

Division 10 items often come with unique challenges:

**Aesthetic Requirements:** These are visible components. Surface finish, color matching, and installation quality matter.

**Coordination with Finishes:** Items install after drywall and paint. Damage prevention and clean installation are critical.

**Institutional Standards:** Healthcare, education, and government projects have specific compliance requirements (CSA, ULC, accessibility codes).

**Last-Minute Changes:** Owner-furnished equipment and signage content often finalize late, compressing fabrication timelines.

## Our Division 10 Approach

### Standard Items: Offshore Value
High-volume, standard-spec items sourced for maximum value:
- Standard locker frames
- Simple partition brackets
- Stock corner guards

### Custom Items: Domestic Speed
Complex or time-sensitive items fabricated locally:
- Custom signage structures
- Non-standard mounting systems
- Rush orders and modifications

### Quality Standards
All Division 10 items receive:
- Dimensional verification
- Finish inspection (powder coat, galvanize, stainless)
- Hardware completeness check
- Installation template verification

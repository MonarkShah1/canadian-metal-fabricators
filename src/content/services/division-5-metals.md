## Your Division 5 Partner for Ontario Construction

Division 5 Miscellaneous Metals encompasses the critical metal components that interface between structural systems and architectural finishes. These items are often the last to be installed but must coordinate precisely with concrete, masonry, and steel—making them high-risk for schedule delays.

CMF specializes in Division 5 fabrication for mid-to-large general contractors working on high-rise residential, commercial, and infrastructure projects across Ontario and Eastern Canada.

## The Division 5 Challenge

Every PM knows Division 5 is where schedules go to die. Here's why:

**Late Design Finalization:** Architectural details often change late in the project, requiring rapid re-fabrication of custom items.

**Field Condition Conflicts:** Embed locations and opening dimensions rarely match drawings exactly. Someone has to fix it fast.

**Multi-Trade Coordination:** Division 5 items interface with concrete (embed timing), structural steel (connections), and finishes (aesthetic requirements).

**Volume vs. Custom Mix:** You need 10,000 linear feet of standard railing *and* 50 one-off brackets for the penthouse.

## The CMF Hybrid Model for Division 5

We structure Division 5 bids to solve both your **budget** and your **schedule**.

### Layer 1: Global Volumetrics (Cost)
Standardized, high-quantity items sourced offshore:
- Standard guardrail sections
- Repetitive stair stringers
- Simple embed plates
- Stock bollards and posts

**Result:** 30-40% cost savings on commodity items.

### Layer 2: Domestic Agility (Schedule)
Custom, urgent, and complex items fabricated locally:
- Complex stair landings
- Last-minute field-measure adjustments
- Prototype units
- "Rescue" fabrication when site conditions change

**Result:** Schedule insurance. We have welders in the GTA ready to fire up tonight.

### Layer 3: Quality Firewall (Risk)
Every offshore shipment:
- Source-inspected at the factory
- Received at our GTA facility
- Uncrated, inspected, and verified before delivery

**Result:** Offshore prices with domestic quality control.

## Our Process

### 1. Specification Review
We review your Division 5 spec package and identify which items are candidates for offshore sourcing vs. domestic fabrication.

### 2. Hybrid Bid Structure
Our quote clearly separates commodity items (offshore) from custom/urgent items (domestic), so you see exactly where your savings come from.

### 3. Production & QC
- Offshore items: Fabricated under our source inspection program
- Domestic items: Manufactured in our GTA facility
- All items: Final QC before delivery

### 4. JIT Delivery
We know you have no laydown space downtown. We store completed items in our yard and deliver piece-by-piece as the crane schedule requires.

## Why General Contractors Choose CMF for Division 5

**Single Point of Accountability:** One PO covers everything from standard railings to custom brackets. No more managing 10 different fab shops.

**The Domestic Backstop:** If a shipment is delayed or site conditions change, we manufacture it right here. Your schedule never slips.

**Construction-Ready Delivery:** Items arrive labeled, staged, and sequenced for installation. Not dumped on site for your crew to sort.

**PM-Focused Communication:** Dedicated project coordination. We know you're juggling 30 trades—we make Division 5 one less thing to worry about.

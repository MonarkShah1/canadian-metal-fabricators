## The Heart of the Hybrid Model

Our Toronto facility is not just a sales office. It is a 40,000 sq ft **Center of Excellence** where we validate every process before it goes global.

### Capabilities On-Site
*   **4kW & 10kW Fiber Lasers** (Emergency Capacity)
*   **3x Amada Press Brakes** (Rapid Prototyping)
*   **CWB Welding Bay** (Process Validation)
*   **Quality Lab** (CMM & Virtek LaserQC)
*   **Safety Stock Warehouse** (JIT Delivery)

### Why This Matters
This facility is your insurance policy. If global supply chains fail, we have the machines, the material, and the manpower right here to keep your line running.

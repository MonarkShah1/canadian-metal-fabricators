# Project Context: Canadian Metal Fabricators (CMF) Website Refresh

## 1. Business Overview
**Name:** Canadian Metal Fabricators (CMF)
**Positioning:** "Hybrid Supply Chain Partner" for major OEMs.
**Core Value Prop:** "Risk-Insured Hybrid Manufacturing."
   - **Mechanism:** Access to LCL (Lower Cost Location) pricing via ISO-certified partners (India) backed by CMF's ISO-certified domestic facility (GTA).
   - **Guarantee:** If global shipping/supply fails, local capacity takes over.
**Goal:** 5x impressions, shifting perception from local "job shop" to sophisticated supply chain partner.

## 2. Target Audience (ICP Analysis)
**Primary User:** Senior Procurement Managers & Supply Chain Directors.
**Psychology:** "Cost of Resilience." They need cost reduction (inflation pressure) but fear supply chain failure (career risk).
**Key Pain Points:**
- **Hidden Costs:** Expedited freight, rework, line-down fees from cheap suppliers.
- **Black Box:** Lack of visibility into overseas production status.
- **Agility:** Inability to scale or pivot quickly with pure offshore models.

## 3. Site Strategy: The "Sales Argument" Flow
The website structure mirrors a high-stakes B2B sales pitch:
1.  **The Hook (Hero):** "Global Cost. Domestic Security." (The Promise).
2.  **The Agitation:** "The Hidden Cost of Fragility." (Exposing the pain of current models).
3.  **The Solution:** "Hybrid Manufacturing Model." (LCL + Safety Stock).
4.  **The Proof:** "Digital Control Tower." (Transparency/Metrics).
5.  **The Capability:** "Capacity from 1 to 100k." (Services).

## 4. Technical Strategy
**Framework:** Astro (SSG).
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS + "Technical" Palette (Slate/Zinc/Blue).
**Architecture:** Siloed Content Collections (`services`, `locations`, `industries`).
**Performance:** Core Web Vitals (LCP/CLS) optimization for trust.

## 5. SEO & Site Architecture
### A. Commercial Silos
- **`/services/`**: Tech specs, capacity data.
- **`/industries/`**: Compliance focus (ISO/CWB).
### B. Local Silos
- **`/locations/`**: Programmatic pages for Map Pack dominance (e.g., `mississauga-laser-cutting`).
### C. Knowledge Silo
- **`/blog/`**: Engineering cost-analysis guides.

## 6. Design & Vibe
**Aesthetic:** Precision Engineering. Dark Mode accents, Monospace data, Wireframe visuals.
**Anti-Pattern:** No "Corporate Stock Photos" of handshakes. Use data visualizations and "Digital Twin" aesthetics.

## 7. Development Workflow
- **Master Doc:** `@docs/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Updates:** Continuous updates.

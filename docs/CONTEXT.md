# Project Context: Canadian Metal Fabricators (CMF) Website Refresh

## 1. Business Overview
**Name:** Canadian Metal Fabricators (CMF)
**Positioning:** "Construction Supply Chain Partner" for General Contractors & Developers.
**Core Value Prop:** "Construction Risk Assurance."
   - **Mechanism:** Hybrid Model. High-volume Division 5/10 metals (Railings, Embeds) produced offshore (Cost), backed by a domestic GTA factory (Speed/Rescue).
   - **Guarantee:** "Domestic Backstop." If global supply fails, local capacity guarantees the critical path.
**Goal:** Dominate the "Construction Metal Management" niche. 5x impressions from Tier 1/2 GCs.

## 2. Target Audience (ICP Analysis)
**Primary User:** Senior Project Managers (PMs), Chief Estimators, Construction Managers.
**Sector:** High-rise Residential, Commercial, Infrastructure.
**Psychology:** "Schedule Defense." They fear Liquidated Damages (LDs) and site delays more than high prices.
**Key Pain Points:**
- **Liquidated Damages:** Late deliveries stopping the entire job site (Crane time = $$$).
- **Laydown Space:** Downtown sites have zero storage; they need Just-In-Time (JIT) delivery.
- **The "Quality Black Hole":** Sub-standard offshore metal arriving that can't be fixed in time.
- **Fragmentation:** Managing 10 different small shops for one project.

## 3. Site Strategy: The "Sales Argument" Flow
The website structure is based on a **"Risk-Reversal" Framework** (PAS: Problem-Agitation-Solution).
*See detailed breakdown in:* `@docs/HOMEPAGE_STRUCTURE.md`

1.  **The Hook (Hero):** "Offshore Economics. Domestic Guarantee."
2.  **The Agitation:** "Saving 20% isn't worth explaining a 3-week delay." (Reputation/Status risk).
3.  **The Solution:** "The Hybrid Shield." (Global Scale + Domestic Rescue).
4.  **The Capability:** Division 5 & 10 Focus (Volume vs. Custom).
5.  **The Process:** "3PL + QC Logistics." (Your laydown area is our yard).
6.  **The Proof:** CWB Certified & On-Time Guarantee.
7.  **CTA:** "Start Your Quote."

## 4. Technical Strategy
**Framework:** Astro (SSG).
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS + "Industrial/Construction" Palette (Safety Yellow accents, Concrete Greys).
**Architecture:** Siloed Content Collections (`services`, `locations`, `projects`).
**Performance:** Ultra-fast load times for mobile (PMs on site).

## 5. SEO & Site Architecture
### A. Commercial Silos
- **`/services/`**: Division 5 (Misc Metals), Division 10, Custom Fab.
- **`/projects/`**: Case studies of "Project Rescues" or "Hybrid Delivery."
### B. Local Silos
- **`/locations/`**: "Toronto Metal Fabrication," "Mississauga Custom Welding."
### C. Knowledge Silo
- **`/blog/`**: "The hidden cost of cheap steel," "How to de-risk Div 5 procurement."

## 6. Design & Vibe
**Aesthetic:** "Site Ready." Clean, data-heavy, blueprint aesthetics, timeline visualizations.
**Anti-Pattern:** No generic "guys in hardhats pointing at blueprints." Use photos of *metal*, *cranes*, and *logistics maps*.

## 7. Development Workflow
- **Master Strategy:** `@docs/CONTEXT.md` & `@docs/ICP_CONTEXT.md`.
- **Updates:** Continuous iteration based on user feedback.
